This notebook usually explains the significance of the topic being coded into the code block below, then uses the equation to run and graph an updated version of the simulation. This can be done as many times as wanted, adding and adding to the existing simulation while keeping the parts separate and making things look, and making things easier to actually implement. Not to mention the easiness of updating the simulation to another version in in CI/CD workflow.\n",
