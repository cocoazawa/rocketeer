# rocketeer (DX)

Open source rocket simulation tool created for a CompSci course and for hobby rockets.  
  
Based on OpenRocket, idea-wise, not actually.  
Made and maintained by Pete Kou.  

This branch is a "developer experimental" branch, and is not expected to work. It will merge with the main branch whenever it looks to be fine and in a "releasable" state

## Usage

Not for usage, but run ```./RocketeerDX``` to run the binary file.
